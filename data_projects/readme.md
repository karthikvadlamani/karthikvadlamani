# Concepts
## 1. Imbalanced Learning
- This notebook contains my learnings about Class Imbalance problems and ways to deal with it.
- Specifically, measuring performance metrics relevant to Imbalance learning - AUC ROC, Average Precision, Balanced Accuracy.
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation on a synthetic dataset, trained a Decision Tree Classifier and a Logistic Regression Classifier.
- Varied class weights as: Equal weights for both classes as 'baseline'; assigning Imbalance ratio as weight to majority class.
- Measured performance and plotted decision boundaries for train and test data, as well as without train and test data.
- Learned the concepts from - https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_6_ImbalancedLearning/Introduction.html
